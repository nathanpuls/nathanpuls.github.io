The Small Group brand was born from a deep appreciation for values that are dear to my heart, such as emotional intelligence and human connection. At its core, our brand is built upon the idea of creating a space for individuals to connect with one another, to share their experiences, and to grow as individuals. Our name, "Small Group," is a nod to the powerful impact that group therapy can have on people's lives. By bringing together individuals in a small and intimate setting, we create a safe and supportive environment where everyone's voice can be heard, and their feelings can be validated. Through this process of sharing and listening, we hope to help our clients experience meaningful growth and transformation. We believe that everyone deserves to have a space where they feel seen and heard, and we are committed to creating that space through our Small Group brand.
